			<p>Muscle Cars is a term used for American high performace cars, usually rear-wheel drive and fitted with a large, powerful V8, manufactured in 1960 through 1970. 
			They are usually associated with drag racing and have good performance in straight lines, and not cornering.</p>

				<p>The definition of Muscle Cars is subject to interpretation, but they usually have many of the following characteristics:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A large V8 engine in the most powerful configuration offered for a particular model</li>
					<li>Rear-wheel drive</li>
					<li>Being manufactured in the United States in the 1960s or early 1970s (the specific year range of 1964–1973 is sometimes used)</li>
					<li>A relatively lightweight two-door body (opinions vary as to whether high-performance full-size cars, 
					compacts, and pony cars qualify as muscle cars,[10] as it is sometimes claimed that only intermediate cars can be considered muscle cars)</li>
					<li>An affordable price</li>
					<li>Being designed for straight-line drag racing, while remaining street legal.</li>
				</ul>

						One of the most popular brands, and for good reason, Chevrolet has created many high-power, v8 cars that were and are very popular untill this day.
						The reason for this is their large selection of models and especially engines. They had a great selection of big displacement, performace V8's that would be available
						almost all of their models, such as the 454 v8, which is has a displacement of 454 cubic inches (7.4L), and a selection of even higher displacement engines that were not 
						available in models but were aftermarket engines designed for dragsters. Chevy's engines could easily be modified to provide tremendous amount of power, for example a 454 
						with two aftermarket four-barrel carburetors can easily produce over 500 HP, and if superchared, power of over 1000 HP can be achieved.

							Drag racing is a type of motor racing in which automobiles or motorcycles (usually specially prepared for the purpose) compete,
							usually two at a time, to be first to cross a set finish line. The race follows a short, straight course from a standing start 
							over a measured distance, most commonly 1⁄4 mi (1,320 ft; 402 m), with a shorter (1,000 ft (305 m)) becoming increasingly popular, 
							as it has become the standard for Top Fuel dragsters and funny cars, where some major bracket races and other sanctioning bodies 
							have adopted it as the standard, while the 1⁄8 mi (660 ft; 201 m) is also popular in some circles. 
							Electronic timing and speed sensing systems have been used to record race results since the 1960s.
